### Personal Projects
* **MaxSoft WebBot Framework for Web UI Test Automation**
  * The main reason for developing this framework is to provide an easy way for Technical QA/Developer/Non-technical QA to perform Web UI testing.
  * Advantages:
    * Code free web UI automation.
    * Generation of an executable document.
    * Human readable tests, business language and Markdown syntax.
    * Tests can be designed even by a non- technical person.
    * Generate a HTML report with test details for every test execution.
    * Parallel execution.
    * Live execution report.
    * Automated emails for test execution summary with graphical representations.

* **MaxSoft GReporter**
  * In testing perspective, the test execution report is a vital document where the stakeholders can get an idea of the project health.
  * Gauge is proving a detailed test execution report with all the error messages and the screenshots incorporated to the failing steps.
  * But anyhow we should manually send the test execution report to the stakeholders by mentioning the number of scenarios executed, passed count, failed count and skipped count. Also in a regression cycle, we have to send those counts as module wise figures. Further we are embedding pie charts and bar charts to that report to represents the test execution data in a high readable manner.
  * Here I have given an automated solution for this issue by developing a Java plugin for gauge to send the test execution summary to a defined audience.
